1.General
~~~~~~~~~
- The faastest (I think!) Bullcreator ever written, creates 13 bulls with
  568 Users found in the user.data in less than 12 sec.!

- Configurable via Textfile for maximum speed

- Supports for every bull an own Bullheader (V0.5).

- Supports 64-Bit Calculations for User's Upload/Download bytes and also
  for the total system byte statistics.

- Supports external Design Files much like Bobo's Multi-Top. (V1.3)

2.Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, copy the util wherever you want, I recommend to use FAME:Doors/ as
destination, as this program is only useful when you've a working FAME
installed.

Copy the supplied Header/ directory to the same directory where mULTI-tOP
is located. This directory contains all headers for the bulletins. Further
informations at the end of the document!

Now edit the supplied cfg-File to your own needs, but remember, it's name
must be 'MULTI-TOP.CFG' and it has to be found in the same dir you stored
Multi-Top!!!

Here's an example for the Cfg-File of Multi-Top:

Description of Configfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Multitop only take care about the first 18 lines of this configfile, all other
lines are ignored. If you don't want to create all bulletins, simply write
a '-' instead of the path and filename for the bull, so Multi-Top skips this
entry.

                  1. Line : Path & name to user.data
                  2. Line : Path & name for the User-List
                  3. Line : Path & name for Top Uploaders (bytes)
                  4. Line : Path & name for Top Downloaders (bytes)
                  5. Line : Path & name for Top Uploaders (files)
                  6. Line : Path & name for Top Downloaders (files)
                  7. Line : Path & name for Top Upload CPS
                  8. Line : Path & name for Top Download CPS
                  9. Line : Path & name for Top Callers
                 10. Line : Path & name for Top Message Writers
                 11. Line : Path & name for Top Nuked Bytes
                 12. Line : Path & name for Top Nuked Files
                 13. Line : Path & name for Top SysOp-Chatters
                 14. Line : Path & name for Top overall Hacks
                 15. Line : Name of your BBS
                 16. Amount of Users to display (User-List ignores!)
                 17. If SHOWSYSOP is set, the SysOp will be added to the stats
                 18. Path to all external design files

Now you have to create a textfile (maybe called MULTITOP) and start Multitop.
I.e., you have copied Multi-Top to your FAME:DOORS/MT/ Dir, you have to write
in your Script:

                          FAME:DOORS/MT/Multi-Top

That's it! Infact of using the CFG-File no parameters needed for Multi-Top.
Now copy this textfile to your Node logoff batches directories.

Please don't forget to set the 'S'-ProtectionBit for your script to allow
FAME to execute it by calling it with his name!!!


3.How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Simple, but efficient! When started, Multi-Top reads in the Configuration,than
all your user.datas. After reading, it begins to create all bulletins you have
supplied a filename for at once, no other readings from the user.data are
neccessary, and this is the speed Multi-Top reaches when creating the bulls,
but has the disadvantage of the amount of memory that mULTI-tOP uses. If you
have not enough memory to store your complete user.datas into memory, mULTI-
tOP won't be able to create bulletins.


4.Headersupport (New for V0.5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mULTI-tOP supports for every Bulletin an own header which will be displayed
on top of the bull. To support this, you must have a directory called
Header/, which must contain the following files for the header-support:

    UL_BYTES.TXT  ---> Header for the Top Bytes Uploader Bull
    DL_BYTES.TXT  ---> Header for the Top Bytes Downloader Bull
    UL_FILES.TXT  ---> Header for the Top Files Uploader Bull
    DL_FILES.TXT  ---> Header for the Top Files Downloader Bull
      UL_CPS.TXT  ---> Header for the Top CPS Uploading Bull
      DL_CPS.TXT  ---> Header for the Top CPS Downloading Bull
     CALLERS.TXT  ---> Header for the Top Callers Bull
    MESSAGES.TXT  ---> Header for the Top Message Writer Bull
 NUKED_BYTES.TXT  ---> Header for the Top Nuked Bytes Bull
 NUKED_FILES.TXT  ---> Header for the Top Nuked Files Bull
       CHATS.TXT  ---> Header for the Top SysOp-Chatters Bull
    USERLIST.TXT  ---> Header for the User-List Bull
       HACKS.TXT  ---> Header for the Top overall hacks Bull (V0.60)

You must not use this files, if you want no header for a specific bull,
simply delete the according file and mULTI-tOP will create the bull without
the header.


5.Using External Design files (New for V1.3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mULTI-tOP supports now external design files, allowing you to customize the
whole output mULTI-tOP generates.
An external design file is just a 'template' to use for the output. It contains
some special command strings which mULTI-tOP uses to replace them with the
according values.
